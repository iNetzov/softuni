### Behind the project:
The project is created as a school assignment for SoftUni.
The main business idea of the project is to create an online shop that sells coffee and other products, some sort of a Barista Store.
The application is created with **Spring Boot**, so the server the application is hosted on is **TomCat**. For the database of the application, i have used **MySQL**, because it is free to use and it scales well as a relational database. The front-end is created with **Thymeleaf** engine in combination with **HTML** **CSS**, **vanilla JS** for some dynamic elements on the web pages.
### Main functionality 
The project follows the concept of MVC architecture.
As I have said earlier the main goal of this application is to sell products from different stores. The application provides **login/registration** pages where users can register themselves and receive different benefits. The access to pages is provided by Spring Security it also manages threads like **SQL injection and DDoS attacks.** The application provides the user with **3 levels of accessibility**.
The **non-logged user** can only browse products.
The **logged user** can see all products, stores and can make orders.
The **moderator** is a special user who is more like a worker in the stores. He can **add** and **remove** products and stores he has a **moderator panel** that is visible only to him and other moderators.
The **Admin** is the user with the biggest value for the store he is the owner of the website. He can see a special web page called **admin panel** where he has functionalities like **checking done orders**, **viewing statistics**, and even **managing other users roles**, he can both **promote and demote a certain user if needed**.
